# bus-tracker

## Description

This application allows the user to programmatically track the travel of the bus between the MIT campus and Harvard University campus. The bus makes stops at each bus-stop along the way between the two universities.

## How to Run

Click on the big button called Show stops between MIT and Harvard. The marker will move from the first bus stop on the campus of MIT to the next and continue to move until the campus of Harvard.

## Roadmap

In the future, additional improvements to the map may include an addition of a control navigation button in the lower right corner where a user may zoom in or zoom out to view details or have a larger view of the map. Another addition could make the current marker draggable.
